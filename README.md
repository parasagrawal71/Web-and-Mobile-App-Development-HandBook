Each folder contains one project folder that contains the code that I have tried while learning that language or technology.   
It also contains the links or any notes related to that language, or framework, etc.   

FOLLOW This (starting with small letter):   
	1. Write the project folder name same as language name. Example, kotlin.   
	2. Write the App or Package name as [language name]+"Learning". Example, kotlinLearning (if capital letter is not allowed as in react, write as reactlearning).   
	3. In React Native, write package idenifier or bundle identifier name as com.learning.reactNative. Similarly in other languages.
